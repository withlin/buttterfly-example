* Before you submit a question, search the archive to see if there is a problem.

* Check if the issue has been fixed, please use the latest version of the master repository to develop.

* As much as possible in the report to explain the problem, for example, what is your environment? What browser and operating system are experiencing problems? Do other browsers have different display errors? What do you expect from the results? It's best to reproduce the error, provide clear steps or a demo.

* Please fork a copy to your own project, do not build branches directly under the warehouse.

* The commit information should be filled in as `[component name]: description information`, for example `[canvas]:fix xxx bug`.

* If you have fixed the bug or added a code to test, add a test!

* Be sure to rebase before submitting the PR to keep the commit records clean.

* Make sure the PR is committed to the `dev` branch instead of the `master` branch.

* If the bug is fixed, please give a description in the PR.
